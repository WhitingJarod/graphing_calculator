A graphing calculator I made for Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures.

The assignment was to parse single-digit numbers, the letter `x`, parentheses, and the four main operators, `+ - / *`.

I was learning about compilers at the time, so I went beyond the scope of the assignment to add some additional functionality.
- whitespace is allowed but ignored
- numbers can be multiple digits and can include decimals and negatives.
- unary negation
- `x^2` or `x2` for exponentiation
- `2x` is the same as `2 * x`
- `(2x+4)(x-2)` calculates as you'd expect
- `|x|` for absolute value
